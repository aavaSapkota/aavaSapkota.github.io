        So for those of you who read my About me page, you all know that I am a
        Highschool student. Well, for every Computer Science class I have taken
        up till now, I have had to create a video game for our final project.
        Many of these games are painfully easy, but they all contain the 4 key
        aspect of Videos Games that you need to know on your quest to become the
        best Java Game Developer you can be!

      <h4 id=#setting-up>Setting up</h4>

      <p>
        The first thing that you need when you start on a game is the main
        screen setup. To setup a Java swing application, you first need a
        JFrame.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code
          >import javax.swing.*;<br />

          public class Main{<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JFrame frame; <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public Main(){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame = new
          JFrame(“Insert Window Title”);<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
          //end program when window closes<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame.setSize(700,500);
          //set width and height of window<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame.setVisible(true);
          //set window visibility to true (so it shows window<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
          //put window in center of screen<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
          }
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        Every time a new JFrame object is made, those lines need to be there to
        set it up. Word of advice, don’t use multiple JFrames to make your game.
        It is typically better to keep everything to one screen and simply add
        and remove components as needed. <br /><br />
        Once the screen is set up, it’s important to look at the screen flow.
        One of the most important components of a game is the carry between the
        different screens. This surprisingly simple concept has caused many
        problems for me in the past. The process of screen flow gets more
        complicated when two different classes are both controlling screen flow.
        What I did for my Gr.12 ISP was to create a user input class that
        handled all of the input for the game, including the mouse and key
        inputs.
        <br /><br />
        I started my isp by working out the simple screen flow using buttons,
        which I would latter switch out for mouse input. Once all of our screens
        were created, I created a User Input class to control the input of the
        game. The User Input class was linked back to the Main method by using a
        JFrame parameter in it’s constructor. This means, that when an instance
        of the User input class was created in the Main class, it required a
        JFrame object. The Main class’s JFrame object was inserted as a
        parameter, linking the two classes.
        <br /><br />
        This worked because, unlike primitive data types, when objects are
        passed as a parameter, their reference is passed. The following
        illustrates the concepts behind the shared JFrame Reference:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <img src="img/frame inheritance.svg">

      </div>
      <p>
          To link both classes to one JFrame, the userinput class has to 
          take in a JFrame as a parameter. This way when an instance of 
          the userinput class is made inside of the main class, the local 
          JFrame can be put in as the userinput object's constructor parameter. 
          Due to the fact that when objects are passed as parameters their 
          references are shared, this results in the JFrames from both classes 
          to share the same reference to the same JFrame object. This means that 
          once the JFrame object is changed in one class, the reference of the 
          object will changes the behavior of the JFrame in the other class. 
   
      </p>

      <p>
        I used this same concept when creating my other classes and made it so
        each of these classes were running in parallel rather than just
        individually. This concept will make drawing on one JFrame between
        classes a lot easier.
      </p>

      <h4 id=user-input>User Input</h4>

      <p>
        Without user input, a game is just an animation. When creating a game,
        you need to decide how the user will interact with the game. In Java
        swing, there are 3 main user input methods mouse input, key input, and
        buttons. In my game, I use a mix of mouse and key input. To use multiple
        mediums of input, two classes should be made, one to handle each type of
        input. <br /><br />
        When I started out my video game, I started out by working on trying to
        integrate the different mediums of input. To use mouse and key inputs
        the following library needs to be imported into your code:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          import java.awt.event.*;
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        I decided to make most of the user input mouse based through clicks, and
        the player movement in game two to use key input. Within the user input
        class, there are two private classes. <br /><br />
        Mouse Adapter:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          private class ML extends MouseAdapter{<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int x = e.getX();
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int y = e.getY();
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
          }
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        This class is used to evaluate any mouse input that the program receives
        as it runs. When you only want to use one type of mouse input, its best
        to make a private class that extends Mouse Adapter rather than having a
        class implement an interface without using all of the methods.
        <br /><br />
        The next type of input method that you can use is Keyboard input. Often
        times this input is used predominantly for player movement, but it can
        be used for screen navigation as well.
        <br /><br />
        Key Adapter private class.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          private class AL extends KeyAdapter{<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.keyReleased(e);
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.keyPressed(e);<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />

          }
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        As you can see in the code, the keyReleased and keyPressed methods are
        being called from another an object in a different class. In this case,
        the object is from the player class, where the methods keyReleased and
        keyPressed are located.<br /><br />
        Here are the methods:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int key = e.getKeyCode();<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_UP){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_DOWN){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />
          }<br /><br />

          public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int key = e.getKeyCode(); <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_LEFT){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_RIGHT){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_UP){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(key == KeyEvent.VK_DOWN){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//implementation not
          shown<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />
          }
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        Each key event represents a time when a key was pressed and key codes
        (KeyEvent.VK_DOWN) identify the key that was pressed. When setting up
        player movement, the most common key codes used are typically the arrow
        keys or a-w-s-d.
        <br /><br />
        So far, you have only seen the private classes, but to really implement
        these classes they need to have their objects instantiated. You can do
        this in the constructor of your User Input class
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          public UserInput(JFrame game, Vars screen){<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.game = game; <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this.screen = screen; <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game.addMouseListener(new ML()); <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game.addKeyListener(new AL()); <br />

          }
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        To actually access inputs from peripherals, listeners need to be added
        to the JFrame to get the input from the peripherals. Once all this is
        setup, you can start getting input from the user to start the game.
      </p>

      <h4 id=collision>Collision:</h4>
      <p>
        Collison detection is a big part of many games. To detect collision,
        many programmers use rectangle collision. This means that you set up a
        rectangular field around whatever two object you want colliding and
        check if any points on the rectangle cross over.
      </p>
      <div class="example">
        <code>
          private Boolean intersect(Object a, Object b){<br/>
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return
          (a.getX()>=b.getX()&&a.getX()&lt;=b.getX()+b.getWidth())&(a.getY()>=b.getY()&&a.getY()&lt;=b.getY()+b.getHeight())||(a.getX()+a.getWidth()>=b.getX()&&a.getX()+a.getWidth()&lt;=b.getX()+b.getWidth())&&(a.getY()+a.getHeight()>=b.getY()&&a.getY().getHeight()&lt;=b.getY()+b.getHeight());<br/>
          }
        </code>
      </div>

      <h4 id=graphics-animations>Graphics and Animations</h4>
      <p>
        Any and every game has graphics of some form or another. Lets take a
        look at how to start applying graphics to your game. <br /><br />
        There are two main ways that you can add graphics to your program: 1.
        Make a class that extends JPanel or Create a JLabel object that embeds a
        paintComponent method.
        <br /><br />
        If the Animation or Graphic that you want to create involves userinput,
        its better to make a new class and track the userinput with an action
        listener method as follows:
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          import javax.swing.*; <br />
          import java.awt.event.*;<br />
          import javax.swing.Timer; <br /><br />

          public JPanelPage extends JPanel implements ActionListener{<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timer timer; <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public JPanelPage (){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;addKeyListener(new
          AL()); <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timer = new Timer(5,
          this); <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;timer.start();<br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e){<br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//insert logic
          statements<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void painComponent(Graphics g){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super.painComponent();
          <br /><br />

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//insert Graphics<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />

          }
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        In this setup, you would draw all of the graphics in your paintComponent
        method, and carryout all the logic in the actionPerfomed method. Unlike
        the other event methods, the action performed method continuously checks
        for input, and does not rely on any specific event to occur for it to
        run. The paintComponent method should be used only for graphics and any
        logic should be put into the actionPerformed method.
        <br /><br />
        To setup an animation a timer is needed to run the animation. As
        displayed in the code above, the Timer object is initiated with 2
        arguments. The first argument determines what interval the timer will
        refresh, and the second is the object that the timer will operate in.
        The start method starts the timer and the timer.stop method will stop
        the timer.
        <br /><br /><br />
        For static drawings, you can imbed the paintComponent method when
        initializing a JLabel to add onto your Jframe.
      </p>

      <div class="example">
        <code>
          JLabel label = new JLabel(){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public void paintComponenet(Graphics g){<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super.paintComponent(g);
          <br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;//insert graphics
          commands<br />
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br />
          };<br />
        </code>
      </div>
